# snakegameai

personal project where i learn ai and machine learning concepts (mainly neural networks & reinforcement learning) through the classic arcade game "snake"

to-do:
1. add visuals for neural network
2. be able to run multiple simulations simultaneously
3. try and test results using a recurrent neural network (rnn)
